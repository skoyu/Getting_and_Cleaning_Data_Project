# Peer-graded Assignment 3: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
# Variables used in the data set
The data from the downloaded file has the following variables: x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, subject_train and subject_test.

# Transformation of the original data
We merge the training and the test date sets to create a single data set.
X_merge, Y_merge and Subject_merge are the new variables merged from the previous dataset. The new data set is generated by extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. We named the activities in the data set by using appropriate descriptive activity names. Finally, we created a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# R script
File with R code "run_analysis.R" perform the following steps (in accordance assigned task of course work).

1) Download the dataset
2) Assign each data to variables
3) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
4) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
5) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
6) Export final tidy data to OutputTidyData.txt file.
